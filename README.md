🚀 CampusPulse
  An AI-Powered Smart Helpdesk for College Campuses

  CampusPulse is a college-specific AI chatbot designed to provide students and faculty with instant, accurate, and centralized access to campus-related information. By leveraging Google’s AI technologies,          CampusPulse transforms fragmented academic and administrative data into a single intelligent conversational interface, improving communication efficiency and enhancing the overall campus experience.

❓ Problem Statement

  In most educational institutions, essential campus information such as academic schedules, class timetables, faculty details, event announcements, and administrative updates is scattered across notice boards,     emails, websites, and informal messaging groups. This fragmented dissemination of information leads to confusion, misinformation, repeated manual queries, and increased dependency on administrative staff and      seniors.

  The absence of a centralized, intelligent system makes it difficult for students—especially first-year students—to access reliable and up-to-date information quickly. There is a strong need for a smart, campus-   specific digital helpdesk that can deliver verified information instantly and efficiently.

💡 Solution Overview

  CampusPulse addresses this challenge by acting as an AI-powered digital helpdesk tailored specifically for the college environment. The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) powered by Google’s Gemini    model to understand user queries and provide accurate, context-aware responses based on institution-specific data.
  
  Instead of searching across multiple platforms, users can interact with CampusPulse in a conversational manner to obtain official campus information in seconds. The system is built to be scalable, secure, and     easily updatable, ensuring long-term usability and adaptability.
